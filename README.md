# GMPhotos
This repo is for a simple photo app used for an iOS Mobile Development intro class. 

Class content is divided into different parts, and each part has its own branch, building on previous work.

#### Part one: 
Creates the basic UI of the photo app.  A UICollectionViewController provides the primary interface and photo thumbnails can be viewed in a larger detail view.

#### Part two: 
Wires up a Core Data model to save photos taken by the camera.

#### Part three: 
Queries Core Data to display saved photos in the UICollectionView and detail view controller. Adds the ability to delete a previously saved photo.

#### Part four: 
Fetches the user's location when saving a photo.  Adds the ability to view the location a photo was taken in an MKMapView.

#### Part five: 
Introduces a UIPageViewController, allowing a user to swipe through saved photos without returning to the UICollectionView.
